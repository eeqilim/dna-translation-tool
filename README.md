# DNA Translation Tool

This is a Python Flask project that translates DNA sequences into mRNA and eventually into a protein sequence.

## Usage

1. Enter the DNA sequence (5' to 3') in the provided input field.
   
2. Click the "Submit" button to initiate the translation process.
   
3. The translated results will be displayed, including the DNA template strand, mRNA sequence, protein sequence, mRNA sequence from the start codon, and the protein sequence from the start codon.
   
4. Click the "Reset" button to clear the inputs.

## Running the Application Locally

1. **Install Flask:**
   
   `pip3 install flask`
   
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   
   `python3 -m venv venv`
   
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   
   `source venv/bin/activate` # On Unix or MacOS
   
   `.\venv\Scripts\activate`   # On Windows
   
4. **Start the Flask development server:**
   
   `flask run`
